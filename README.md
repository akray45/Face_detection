# Face_detection
Face detection using openCV
This repository contains pyhton code for face , smile,eyes detections.
I have used cv2 to detect faces through webcam.
We need to load some xml file to train the model.
In this repository we have face,smile,eyes cascade file.
We train on these xml file to train the model.
Cascade helps to detect all the things we are looking for.
Whenever it detects a face it draw a box around it.
Same goes for eyes and smile.
